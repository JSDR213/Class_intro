  <p>My name is Brittany and I will be your <b>Instructor Associate (IA)</b>. I will be here as added support through your journey of becoming a software engineer.</p>
  <p>As a GA graduate, I have been in your shoes and understand what it takes to get through such a course. As for my experience, with a focus in front-end design, I freelanced for multiple clients implementing skills from previous experience with managing teams, data collection, and communication to provide a positive and open space for colleagues and clients. This will be my second cohort as an IA and I am excited to guide and help shape your minds.</p>
